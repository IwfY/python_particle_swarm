Applications:

1. Train a neuronal network

2. path finding
- have a set of connected points inbetween a start and an end point
- fitness is the lenght of the path and the ability to walk it

3. arrange artifacts in a weighted diagram
- so nodes and edges don't overlap and nodes with a strong connection are closer to each other
